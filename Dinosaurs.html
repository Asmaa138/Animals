      <h3>Stegosaurus</h3>
      <p>They were all herbivores (plant eaters) and featured rows of unique bones that developed into plates and spines along their back and tail. The 17 plates found along the back of the Stegosaurus arose from the skin rather than being attached to the skeleton. The largest plates were around 60cm (2ft) tall and 60cm (2ft) wide.</p>

The Spinosaurus was larger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex and may have been the largest carnivorous (meat eating) dinosaur ever. Studies estimate that it was around 15 metres (49 feet) in length and weighed anywhere between 7 to 20 tons. The Spinosaurus featured distinctive spines which grew over 1.5 metres (5 feet) long..</p>
